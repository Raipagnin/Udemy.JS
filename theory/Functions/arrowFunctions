NOT IE SUPPORTED.
New way to write and define functions. You don't need to write the word function anymore, the syntax looks like this:
>> const sqr = (x) => {
    return x*x;
}
>> const sum = (x, y) => {
    return x + y;
}
 the () are optional ONLY if you only have one parameter, like the first example
const sqr = x => {
    return x*x;
}
IMPLICIT RETURN = when an arrow function only have one parameter and doesn't need the return (which is implicit so u swap from {} to ())
>>const sqr = n => (
    n * n
)
Or even taking away the (), and just leaving the => 
>> const sqr =  => n * n;

There's a difference from regular func to arrow ones, but we will see it later on when learning 'this'
