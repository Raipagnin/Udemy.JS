- parentElement = to find the parent of that item. For ex, if I have a <li> and I save it to a const = li:
>> li.parentElement
>> <ul>_</ul>
Because this <li> is inside a <ul> so it shows me the 'higher parent' of this <li>. if i put it 2x then it will show me one step above the <ul>
>> li.parentElement.parentElement
>> <body>_</body>
Let's say it was the order of <body> => <ul> => <li>

- children = the opposite of the above, if more than one element is children of it it will return a HTMLCollection with a list of the children

- nextElementSibling / previousElementSibling = If you have a <ul> with 3 <li>, u can switch from one <li> to another. So from children if u get a HTML collection u can access with [] and as well use these 2
