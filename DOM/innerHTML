Returns not only the text inside a piece, it returns the HTML structure inside. 
An example, let's say u have on your website a form, and it comes with 3 <input> one being username, another one for passowrd and another one for submit. more or less like this:
>> <form action="">
    <input type="text" placeholder="username">
    <input type="text" placeholder="password">
    <input type="submit">
>> </form>
>> form.innerHTML
>> "
    <input type="text" placeholder="username">
    <input type="text" placeholder="password">
    <input type="submit">
   "
It shows the whole tags, atributes and etc inside the element. U can change HTML content with that and even add elements.
