EVERY = 
>> const words = ['dog', 'dig', 'log', 'bag', 'wag'];
>> const all3 = words.every(w => w.length === 3);
>> all3
>> true
in this case every will run the entire array and search every element and check what you're asking, in this case if every word has 3 letters. Because it's boolean it returns true or false. Doesn't change or create anything.
EVERY SINGLE ELEMENT HAS TO CHECK OUT!

SOME = Almost the same, but just as the name, it's not for every single element.
>> const word = words.some(w => w[0] === 'd');
>> word
>>true
Using the example above you can see that not every word starts with 'd', but for some is enough to give a true result, and if i had written with every it would have given me a false result
>> const word2 = words.every(w =>[0] === 'd');
>> word2
>>false
